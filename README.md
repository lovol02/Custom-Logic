# Custom-Logic
Custom-Logic is a web-based tool that represents various logic structures using Google's Blockly library. Built on Node.js, it allows users to create, visualize, and manage logic blocks efficiently.
This is a project aimed to represent the various logic into blocks form, thanks the tool Features:  
    -Visual representation of logic structures using Blockly  
    -Customizable logic blocks through JSON configurations  
    -Easy integration and setup with Node.js and npm  
Prerequisites:  
    -Node.js and npm installed on your machine  

here is the link for npm [download npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)  
After installed the npm, you can simply launch the program at command line of subdirectory custom logic. Using command 'npm start', to start the service.  

Configuration  

To customize the default logic:​  
    1.Navigate to the src directory.​  
    2.Open the jsongenerator.py file.​  
    3.Modify the Input_filename variable to point to your desired JSON configuration file located in the src/Logics directory or any other path.   

To create your own logic you can create a new file json in the Logics folder or any other path(just specify the path to file in the camp "Input_filename" of the file jsongenerator.py).  

In the your own json file you can specify three camp inside a json array, which is "collector", "prototype", "advancedtype"(Of course it not neceessary alway be three, it depends on your need).  

First camp is 'collector', you can specify the "type": "collectors" to declare that you are defining the collector, you can define a json array which contain the blocks that you want them be together and use them as a list.  

Second camp is 'prototype', in this camp you also need use "type": "protoytpe" to declare that you are going to define the blocks there are prototype, you can define your prototype blocks in a json array then put this array inside the "content" camp.   

For every element of array you can define "name" -> block's name, "format"-> in prototype case can use the label(just write the word in the string that you want put in the format.) and the four default value type that start with % to represent it is value type: %string, %int, %double(which have precision 0.00), and %bool, about "connection" this camp is defined on your need, if you need your ablock connected to other block just declare this camp and give it an array of blocks that you want the block you are defining to connect to or just one element.  

Note: the block you defined in the prototype camp in the interpretation phase it will just return the value as it is, not like the advanced type that will start with '(' and closed with ')' , unless you use the connection property, it will close the sequence of block have same 'name' property.  

Third camp is 'advanced_type', in this camp have same operation as prototype, use label and four default value type, the only difference is you can use the %[] to represent a single prototype input variable or an array of prototype or a collector.
